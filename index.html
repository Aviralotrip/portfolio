            <div class="about-text"><p>BoJack F. Horseman (born January 2, 1964) is a fictional character and the titular protagonist of the Netflix animated television series BoJack Horseman (2014â€“2020). He is voiced by Will Arnett and was created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg. Prior to the series start, BoJack had starred in a hit 1990s sitcom called Horsin' Around. After that show ending, BoJack struggled to find acting work, instead of living off residuals from Horsin' Around's syndication.

                BoJack, a self-loathing and alcoholic anthropomorphic narcissistic horse, suffers from depressionand often engages in self-destructive behavior. He frequently drinks and takes drugs to excess and has difficulty maintaining positive relationships with others.</p></div>
